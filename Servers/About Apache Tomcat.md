# To set up a simple Apache Tomcat Server

**In Apache server installation folder ->** put the front-end project files inside webapps folder (could be inside a project folder).

**In/bin/ folder ->** We have the configurations file (xml) and the terminal commands to run or stop the server (commands.sh)

**In /webapps/project-foler ->** create a folder called WEB-INF and creates a web.xml
_Observation: Your first page that will be loaded on the server, must be called index.html_

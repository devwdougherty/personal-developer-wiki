### Kafka and Kafka Stream

#### Differences between Kafka and Kafka Streams*

[Kafka's Streams library](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) is built on top of the Kafka producer and consumer clients. Kafka Streams is significantly more powerful and also more expressive than the plain clients. It's much simpler and quicker to write a real-world application start to finish with Kafka Streams than with the plain consumer. See on: [Kafka: Consumer API vs Streams API](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44014975/kafka-consumer-api-vs-streams-api)

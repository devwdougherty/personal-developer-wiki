sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2
sudo systemctl reload apache2

## Terminal

### File Explorer

#### Directory Structure

- /opt/ - _To install software_

#### To unzip and install a TARGZ
```
$ tar -xvzf package_java.targz 
```
_Optional:_ You can put the directory that has chosen for application directly at end of decompress line
e.g: $ tar -xvzf package_java.targz **/opt/**

_Explanation:_

**f:** this must be the last flag of the command, and the tar file must be immediately after. It tells tar the name and path of the compressed file. 

**z:** tells tar to decompress the archive using gzip 

**x:** tar can collect files or extract them. x does the latter. 

**v:** makes tar talk a lot. Verbose output shows you all the files being extracted. 

#### Move and Copy the unzip package to a root directory 
```
$ sudo mv package_java/ /opt/directory_package_java(You choose) 
$ sudo cp file directory/you/choose 

#### To change file permissions 
```
$ chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh 
```
Explanation: _x (execute) r (read) w (write) - Or 777_
 

#### Change the proprietary of the Folder and SubFolders 
```
$ sudo chown -R nameuser:namegroup /directory 
$ ls â€“l To see the result 
```
